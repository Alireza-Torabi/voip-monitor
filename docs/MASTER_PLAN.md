# Master plan

Status: 2026-09-25. Phase 1 public repository foundation is complete. Phase 2 Task 9 provider runtime lifecycle and authenticated AMI connection-test/discovery foundation is implemented on `feature/provider-runtime-lifecycle`; network access remains disabled by default and no real PBX has been contacted.

## Phase 0 — environment discovery

- [x] Inspect OS, workspace, Git, GitHub CLI, Docker, Compose, Node.js, npm, and files.
- [x] Record observed state; install no system packages and contact no PBX.

## Phase 1 — public repository foundation

### Completed

- [x] Initialize local `main`; keep private `.local/` and runtime paths ignored.
- [x] Create public policy files, English/Persian README and documentation pairs, official Apache-2.0 LICENSE, and ownership-neutral NOTICE.
- [x] Record architecture, decisions, project context, and planned direct dependency license review.
- [x] Add npm workspace manifests, Node.js 24 LTS target, strict TypeScript base config, and documented lint/format/test/build strategy.
- [x] Add service-free Compose foundation and runtime data/secret layout.
- [x] Add CI for existing foundation checks using synthetic/public files only.
- [x] Run the foundation checker and review public files for obvious secrets.

### GitHub closure

- [x] Review staged diff and create the clean initial commit with the user-supplied repository-only Git identity.
- [x] Configure `origin` to the user-supplied repository after confirming no conflicting remote.
- [x] Push the initial foundation commit to GitHub; `main` tracks `origin/main`.
- [x] Verify remote `main` points to `974f0cb2ec471878d58c71639e904bca48bb8aaf` (`chore: establish public repository foundation`).

The earlier local commit `e735f1c` was amended before publication to use the requested noreply identity. It is not in `origin/main` ancestry. The published foundation commit is `974f0cb`.

### Deferred toolchain-dependent gates

- [x] Generate one npm lockfile and audit resolved license identifiers (completed in Phase 2 Task 1).
- [x] Run lint, format, typecheck, tests, and builds for the initial skeleton (completed in Phase 2 Task 1).
- [ ] Validate Docker Compose and build images when Docker and service build contexts exist.

These later checks do not change the historical Phase 1 validation record. Docker validation remains deferred. Local tool availability is recorded only in ignored `.local/`.

## Phase 2 — application foundation

- [x] Task 1: approved local Node 24/npm toolchain, minimal backend `GET /health`, bilingual React shell, one lockfile, quality gates, and CI. Local validation passed; the feature branch was merged into `main` as `e737abd`.
- [x] Task 2: provider-neutral shared contracts, typed capability and source-health models, centralized validated application configuration, and safe configuration errors/log redaction. No PBX or persistence behavior.
- [x] Task 3: SQLite storage abstraction, transactional migration history, setup and minimal PBX metadata persistence, and application readiness.
- [x] Task 4: protected master-key lifecycle, AES-256-GCM PBX secret persistence, readiness integration, and recovery documentation.
- [x] Task 5: protected first-administrator bootstrap, local password authentication, server-side sessions, CSRF and attempt limits, and setup-state transition.
- [x] Task 6: authenticated PBX profile CRUD, provider-scoped AMI metadata, encrypted write-only credentials, configured-unverified setup state, and bilingual setup/login/onboarding UI. No PBX network access.
- [x] Task 7: Asterisk provider network-boundary policy, injected address-resolution boundary, and mock AMI transport foundation. No real DNS lookup, socket, AMI login, or PBX access.
- [x] Task 8: plain TCP AMI wire transport, safe action framing/ActionID/timeout handling, Node DNS resolver boundary, and an Asterisk provider login/discovery/reconcile foundation. Tests use only mocks and a synthetic loopback AMI server; runtime startup still creates no PBX connection.
- [x] Task 9: provider runtime lifecycle with one managed provider per enabled PBX, bounded reconnect/backoff and reconciliation, explicit network enablement, authenticated provider-status and connection-test/discovery APIs, persisted verification timestamp, and bilingual connection-test UI. Tests remain mock/synthetic only; no real PBX access.
- [ ] Proposed next task: AMI event-subscription and normalized provider-event foundation, implemented against synthetic/mock AMI streams before any real PBX test.

## Future phases — pending approval
- [ ] Phase 3: account management and onboarding refinement.
- [ ] Phase 4: Asterisk provider and mock AMI.
- [ ] Phase 5: telephony state engine.
- [ ] Phase 6: system metrics.
- [ ] Phase 7: security monitoring.
- [ ] Phase 8: authenticated API and realtime.
- [ ] Phase 9: bilingual dashboard.
- [ ] Phase 10: history and retention.
- [ ] Phase 11: hardening, backup, and tested restore.
- [ ] Phase 12: release validation.

Phase 1 is closed. Stop after Phase 2 Task 9 and await approval for the next task.
