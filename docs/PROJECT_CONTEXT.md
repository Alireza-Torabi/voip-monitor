# Project context

Status: Phase 7 Task 33 is implemented locally on feature/security-monitoring-ui as of 2026-09-26 after Task 32 merged through PR #34. The backend has normalized AMI authentication-security events, event persistence/API/SSE, bounded alert evaluation, alert persistence/API/SSE, persistent bounded PBX-scoped rule configuration, application-owned runtime evaluation/persistence wiring, and authenticated bounded rule-configuration APIs. The frontend now has the first authenticated bilingual PBX-scoped security workspace for current alerts and the two bounded rules. Realtime/history alert UI, external notification delivery, broader dashboard work, and broader security sources remain future work. License: Apache-2.0.

## Repository state

The public repository tracks origin/main; Task 32 is merged through PR #34. The current branch adds an authenticated bilingual SecurityWorkspace that consumes only existing bounded current-alert and rule-configuration APIs. PBX selection comes from onboarded profiles, rule controls are fixed to the two allowlisted rule IDs, raw provider fields remain absent, and no external notification setting or real-system access is introduced.

## Product constraints

- Runtime configuration and PBX secrets come from setup, never source edits.
- One persistent AMI connection per enabled PBX, independent of browser count.
- Event-driven live state with periodic reconciliation and explicit data freshness.
- Backend entities and metrics are keyed by PBX instance from the start.
- Monitoring failure must not affect telephony.
- Public docs are English and Persian; demo and tests use synthetic data.
- The Git repository stays organization-neutral and portable. Real deployment addresses, credentials, topology, runtime databases, and keys remain outside Git. Before production release, the repository must include a tested fresh-deployment runbook suitable for onboarding a new organization without copying private values from another deployment.

## Private context

`.local/DEPLOYMENT_CONTEXT.md` may contain private test topology and operational notes. It is never committed or copied into tracked docs. Deployment-specific facts must not be recorded in this public file.

## Unknowns

TO_VERIFY: target PBX capabilities, supported deployment hosts, operating policy, and ownership identity for NOTICE. Local development environment facts belong in ignored `.local/`.

## Continuation note

The authoritative execution state, failure/bug log, and handoff instructions live in `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md`. A new session should read that file before proposing or implementing work. Task failures and bugs must be recorded there before closing each task. Deployment-specific Remote Desktop identifiers and real PBX details stay out of tracked public documentation.

## Task 28 — security alert/rule evaluation

Task 28 adds a bounded `SecurityAlertEvaluator` over normalized persisted security events. Only the two allowlisted authentication-failure rule IDs are accepted. Unknown or malformed rules and evaluation/storage errors fail closed. Threshold evaluation uses bounded PBX-scoped history. No external delivery, PBX write, production log access, or real-PBX compatibility claim is part of this task.

Known gap: the repository has independent evaluator smoke validation, but a dedicated committed evaluator test file was not added because the Remote editing seam rejected that file-creation operation.

## Task 29 — security alert persistence/current state

Task 29 adds PBX-scoped alert current/history storage only. Supported alert records are restricted to the two Task 28 rule IDs, bounded matched-event counts, normalized timestamps, and optional provider stream ordering. Current state is independent per rule, history is deterministic and duplicate-safe, retention is bounded, and current state survives history pruning. No automatic evaluation scheduling, alert delivery, PBX mutation, production log access, or real-PBX compatibility claim is part of this task.

## Task 30 — security alert API/realtime

Task 30 exposes persisted alert state only. Current state is returned as the PBX's per-rule current alert set. History uses explicit UTC bounds and a maximum 500 rows. The SSE stream sends the persisted current snapshot and subsequent successfully persisted nonduplicate alerts, is same-origin protected, PBX scoped, heartbeat bounded, and capped at 64 concurrent streams. No external notification target, PBX mutation, production log access, or automatic rule execution is part of this task.

## Task 31 — persistent alert-rule configuration and runtime wiring

Task 31 gives the application one explicit owner for the security event -> rule evaluation -> matched alert persistence path. Configuration is persistent, PBX scoped, bounded to the two existing rule shapes, and cascades on PBX deletion. Failures are isolated and fail closed. There is still no public rule-configuration mutation API/UI or external notification delivery.
